# DEPRECATED use migae-template instead

gaem-template

A Leiningen template for gaem-plugin-managed appengine-magic applications.

** WARNING ** Alpha software.  Works for me (Mac only) but hasn't been
   tested really thoroughly.

   Latest version:  0.2.0-SNAPSHOT

## Installation

Download from https://github.com/greynolds/gaem-template, cd to the dir and run "lein install".

## Usage

    $ lein new gaem myapp:appid /path/to/gae/sdk

Here myapp is the name of your clojure app (in project.clj) and appid is the GAE application ID (as used in appengine-web.xml).

The result is a little web app designed to be useful for exploring
webapp development on GAE and appengine-magic.  It implements two
different servlets, one of which services two different paths, and it
also has a few static html pages, css and javascript.  You can easily
subtract stuff if you want to use it as a starting point for a real
app.

To understand it you should carefully examine project.clj.  Note the
mustache templates in etc.

It is designed to work with the gaem plugin which can be found at
https://github.com/greynolds/gaem.  The plugin is what makes it go; it
supports the configure/compile/test/deploy commands for which we all
yearn.
